# LA-Metro-Tracker

This project provides real-time location of the metro trains on the red line in Los Angeles.

If you want the google map to work, you will need to input an API key on line 54 of index.html

I wrote this website to teach myself about REST APIs. The website makes calls to the LA metro API and gets results returned in JSON and XML. I then plot these results on a google map to show the location and direction of trains in real-time.
